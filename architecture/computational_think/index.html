            <div class="post-content">
                <p>The use of computers in the world of architectural design was initially only used to digitize what is usually done manually. Modeling or drawing using computers still uses additive logic, which is adding information overlapping without any associative relations whose consistency is very dependent on the designer. This additive logic lasts a long time because it is considered stable in the exploration and refinement of variations through traditional image media. This logic has limitations, there is no connection between the elements depicted and cannot include the physically relevant aspects that drive the generation of forms in the real world. This limitation then made the architects to develop their mindset in designing.</p>
<p>In 1963 a tool called the sketchpad was discovered by a computer expert named Ivan Sutherland. This tool is then considered to be the first CAD tool that became the forerunner of popular CAD computer applications in subsequent times. At this point, a shift in the thought process in design from additive logic to associative logic begins. This associative logic then becomes the basis for the use of computing in design which is then supported by the development of information technology and computer science.</p>
<p>In associative logic, the process of manipulating shapes is done directly. It&rsquo;s the same when we cross out a line on a paper. We move our hands and immediately cross out with the length we want. However, the process of manipulating shapes with associative logic is done indirectly by using algorithms. A line is not formed from the movement of our hands, but the line is made from the distance between two points.</p>
<p>The architectural design process that occurs using computers is no longer limited to representative purposes, but utilizes the computer&rsquo;s ability to think and execute instructions through procedures made by the architect. This approach came to be known as computational thinking along with the continued development of computer capabilities to be able to think more complexly and quickly. Computers can generate shapes quickly based on algorithms created by architects. Of course, this must be accompanied by the logical thinking ability of the architect. The advantage of this approach is that it can produce shapes that were previously difficult to do with conventional modeling techniques that rely on additive logic.</p>
<p>In general, computational thinking consists of four techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>decomposition</strong><br>
solving the problem by breaking the problem into several small problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>abstraction</strong><br>
recognizing the key components of the differences in the problem to develop a solution to several problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>pattern recognition</strong><br>
recognizing the similarity of components of a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>algorithm</strong><br>
a set of procedures to solve problems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Computational design is a design process that utilizes computational thinking. Computational design in architectural design continues to develop along with the development of information technology and then produces various new terms such as parametric design, algorithm design, and generative design.</p>
