      <description>The use of computers in the field of architectural design initially only involved digitizing tasks that were traditionally done manually. Computer-based modeling or drawing still relied on additive logic, which involved adding overlapped information without associative relationships, heavily relying on the designer&amp;rsquo;s consistency. This additive logic persisted for a long time as it was considered stable for exploring and refining variations through traditional image media. However, this logic had limitations as it lacked connections between depicted elements and couldn&amp;rsquo;t incorporate physically relevant aspects that shape the generation of real-world forms.</description>
