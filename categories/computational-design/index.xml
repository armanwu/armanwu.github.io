      <description>Generative design, as a powerful approach in architecture, encompasses a range of techniques that push the boundaries of creativity and innovation. By leveraging computational algorithms, generative design unlocks new possibilities and opens up uncharted territories in the realm of architectural exploration. Among the many techniques used in generative design, several prominent ones stand out, including cellular automata, genetic algorithms, shape grammar, and more.&#xA;Cellular automata, first introduced by mathematician John von Neumann and popularized by scientist Stephen Wolfram, provide a fascinating tool for generative design.</description>

      <description>In the complex world of architecture, generative design has emerged, opening doors to thousands of possibilities for harmonious and aesthetic designs. The collaboration between humans and computers gives rise to surprising solutions, unearthing new ideas with unlimited freedom.&#xA;Generative design involves the consideration of complex factors, including spatial layout, lighting, and energy efficiency. In this remarkable process, algorithms can be programmed to optimize designs based on specific criteria, creating unexpected harmony in the combination of variables.</description>

      <title>Computational Thinking in Architectural Design Process</title>

      <description>The use of computers in the field of architectural design initially only involved digitizing tasks that were traditionally done manually. Computer-based modeling or drawing still relied on additive logic, which involved adding overlapped information without associative relationships, heavily relying on the designer&amp;rsquo;s consistency. This additive logic persisted for a long time as it was considered stable for exploring and refining variations through traditional image media. However, this logic had limitations as it lacked connections between depicted elements and couldn&amp;rsquo;t incorporate physically relevant aspects that shape the generation of real-world forms.</description>
