      <description>The use of computers in the world of architectural design was initially only used to digitize what is usually done manually. Modeling or drawing using computers still uses additive logic, which is adding overlapped information without any associative relations, whose consistency is very dependent on the designer. This additive logic lasts a long time because it was considered stable in the exploration and refinement of variations through traditional image media. This logic has limitations, there&amp;rsquo;s no connection between the elements depicted and cannot include the physically relevant aspects that drive the generation of forms in the real world.</description>
