<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to influence various industries, including architecture, it raises important questions: How can the intuitive intelligence built over years of experience be combined with algorithmic logic? Both have powerful roles, and when united, they can create a new harmony in the world of architecture. However, to achieve this balance, architects need to understand how to work with AI while maintaining the essence of their intuition.</p>
<h2 id="essential-skills-for-architects-in-the-age-of-ai">Essential Skills for Architects in the Age of AI</h2>
<p>To effectively leverage AI, architects need to develop a range of skills that support the collaboration between creative intuition and technical capabilities. Here are the key skills that architects should focus on:</p>
<h3 id="programming-and-algorithmic-logic">Programming and Algorithmic Logic</h3>
<p>Programming is at the heart of every AI system. For architects, mastering programming provides the ability to actively define how AI works and generates design solutions that align with their vision. The most widely used programming language in AI is Python, known for its ease of use and extensive AI libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, which facilitate the development of machine learning and deep learning models.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why Programming is Crucial for Architects: Programming allows architects to define parameters, constraints, and design goals directly within AI systems, giving them greater control over the generative output. For example, in generative design, architects can tweak the algorithms that generate new forms to match their aesthetic preferences and technical requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual Programming as an Alternative: For architects who may not want to dive into conventional coding, tools like Grasshopper (for Rhino) and Dynamo (for Revit) offer visual programming environments that allow them to harness AI and parametric design algorithms without writing code directly. These visual platforms enable architects to create complex algorithmic workflows by graphically linking design elements, making AI interaction easier within the design process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="machine-learning-and-data-science">Machine Learning and Data Science</h3>
<p>Machine learning (ML) is a critical branch of AI that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or generate new patterns. For architects, understanding machine learning principles is key to leveraging data in the design and evaluation of projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Applying ML in Architecture: Machine learning can be used to predict building performance, such as energy efficiency or structural behavior, based on data from previous projects. For example, AI can be trained to recognize energy usage patterns across different climates and provide design recommendations that significantly improve energy efficiency. This is particularly relevant in sustainable architecture, where energy performance is a key aspect to optimize.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Importance of Data Science: Alongside machine learning, architects need to master data science, which involves gathering, cleaning, and analyzing large-scale data to inform design decisions. Tools like Pandas and NumPy in Python help architects manipulate and analyze building data, including information on climate, materials, and user behavior patterns. Using data visualization tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn is also crucial to help architects visually understand data and make informed decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="generative-design-and-parametrics">Generative Design and Parametrics</h3>
<p>Generative design is one of the most revolutionary AI applications in architecture. By inputting a set of parameters—such as site size, height restrictions, energy efficiency goals, and material preferences—AI can generate hundreds, even thousands, of optimized design options.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How Generative Design Assists Architects: With tools like Autodesk Generative Design or Grasshopper, architects can use AI to explore forms that may be difficult to achieve through traditional methods. AI enables architects to test numerous variations of form and structure in a short period, offering greater room for creative exploration. For instance, a residential project designed to maximize natural light exposure and ventilation can be optimized by AI, producing various configurations of building massing and room layouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parametric Design as a Backbone for Generative Design: Generative design heavily relies on parametric design, where every aspect of the design is interconnected through parameters that can be modified quickly. This allows architects to experiment with endless design variations instantly. For example, a slight change in window size or building orientation can automatically generate new forms that remain aligned with the project&rsquo;s original parameters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-information-modeling-bim-and-ai">Building Information Modeling (BIM) and AI</h3>
<p>Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become an industry standard in architectural projects. However, when combined with AI, BIM becomes a far more intelligent and dynamic tool.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AI for Performance Prediction and Analysis: AI can analyze BIM data to predict building performance, such as energy efficiency and structural durability. Using AI, architects can anticipate building maintenance needs before major issues arise, based on historical data embedded in the BIM model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smarter Clash Detection: AI also enhances clash detection, where AI not only detects clashes between building elements but also provides intelligent solutions based on data from past projects. AI can prioritize which clashes to resolve first and offer recommendations to speed up the construction process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimizing Project Scheduling and Costs: Beyond clash detection, AI can also leverage BIM data to optimize project scheduling and predict more realistic costs. AI learns from previous projects to offer insights into time and cost estimates based on real-world conditions, helping architects avoid potential delays and cost overruns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool for speeding up design processes and generating more efficient solutions, but the architect&rsquo;s intuition remains an irreplaceable element. The technical skills required to harness AI allow architects to balance innovation with human creativity. Architects who succeed in the AI era are those who can merge their artistic instincts with intelligent algorithms, creating designs that are not only efficient but also meaningful to human experience.</p>

            <guid>https://armanwu.github.io/posts/2023/07/understanding-game-age-ratings-protecting-children-from-inappropriate-content/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Many parents are concerned about the types of games their children play. They worry that some games may not be suitable for their child’s age. However, what they often don’t realize is that every game actually comes with an age rating determined by the developer and publisher. These ratings are designed to guide parents in deciding whether a game is appropriate for their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every game developer and publisher has a target market in mind, and they pay close attention to this when setting an age rating. The rating is based on the game’s content—such as violence, strong language, or sexual themes. For example, a game that contains intense violence will be given a higher age rating than one that is more family-friendly. Parents should understand that these ratings are not just suggestions, but important guidelines to help them choose the right games for their children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The rating is based on the game’s content—such as violence, strong language, or sexual themes. For example, a game that contains intense violence will be given a higher age rating than one that is more family-friendly. Parents should understand that these ratings are not just suggestions, but important guidelines to help them choose the right games for their children.</p>
<h2 id="international-age-rating-coalition-iarc">International Age Rating Coalition (IARC)</h2>
<p>The International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) is an organization that coordinates various age-rating systems worldwide. IARC brings together systems used in regions such as the United States, Europe, and Australia. Its goal is to provide consistent and standardized guidance for parents and players when choosing age-appropriate games.</p>
<p>One widely used system is the Pan European Game Information (PEGI). PEGI is applied in most European countries and assigns ratings based on game content such as violence, coarse language, or sexual material. PEGI ratings cover age categories ranging from 3 years (PEGI 3) to 18 years (PEGI 18), with explanations for the assigned rating.</p>
<p><img src="/img/PEGI.png" alt="Game categories according to PEGI" title="Kategori game menurut PEGI"></p>
<p>Another well-known system is the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), used in North America. The ESRB provides ratings similar to PEGI, with categories such as Everyone (E), Teen (T), and Mature (M). ESRB also includes content descriptors to highlight areas of concern.</p>
<p><img src="/img/ESRB.png" alt="Game categories according to ESRB" title="Kategori game menurut ESRB"></p>
<h2 id="indonesia-game-rating-system-igrs">Indonesia Game Rating System (IGRS)</h2>
<p>In addition to international systems, Indonesia has its own rating framework called the Indonesia Game Rating System (IGRS). IGRS was introduced to give parents and players in Indonesia guidance about game content and age suitability.</p>
<p><img src="/img/IGRS.png" alt="Game categories according to IGRS" title="Kategori game menurut IGRS"></p>
<p>At present, IGRS mainly covers locally developed games. This means that popular international titles created by foreign developers may not carry IGRS ratings. For example, popular games such as Fortnite, Call of Duty, or FIFA may not have an IGRS rating to help parents decide on suitability for their children.</p>
<p>This limitation highlights the need to expand IGRS coverage to include international titles widely played in Indonesia. Doing so would allow parents to access more comprehensive information about game content and appropriate age levels.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, IGRS remains a positive step in raising awareness of age ratings in Indonesia and providing useful guidance for local games. Parents can certainly benefit from IGRS when considering Indonesian titles. However, it is recommended that they also consult established international systems like PEGI or ESRB for a more complete perspective when selecting games for their children.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In today’s digital world, understanding game age ratings is key to protecting children from inappropriate content. Parents should recognize that every game comes with a rating provided by its developer or publisher, and that this serves as an important guideline in choosing suitable titles. By relying on international rating systems such as PEGI and ESRB, alongside Indonesia’s IGRS, parents can act as wise guides—ensuring their children enjoy games safely and in ways appropriate for their age.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The use of computers in the field of architectural design initially only involved digitizing tasks that were traditionally done manually. Computer-based modeling or drawing still relied on additive logic, which involved adding overlapped information without associative relationships, heavily relying on the designer&amp;rsquo;s consistency. This additive logic persisted for a long time as it was considered stable for exploring and refining variations through traditional image media. However, this logic had limitations as it lacked connections between depicted elements and couldn&amp;rsquo;t incorporate physically relevant aspects that shape the generation of real-world forms. These limitations prompted architects to develop their design mindset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The use of computers in the field of architectural design initially only involved digitizing tasks that were traditionally done manually. Computer-based modeling or drawing still relied on additive logic, which involved adding overlapped information without associative relationships, heavily relying on the designer&rsquo;s consistency. This additive logic persisted for a long time as it was considered stable for exploring and refining variations through traditional image media. However, this logic had limitations as it lacked connections between depicted elements and couldn&rsquo;t incorporate physically relevant aspects that shape the generation of real-world forms. These limitations prompted architects to develop their design mindset.</p>
<p>In 1963, a computer expert named Ivan Sutherland discovered a tool called the Sketchpad, which is considered the first CAD tool and served as a precursor to popular CAD computer applications in subsequent years. This marked the transition from additive logic to associative logic. Associative logic became the foundation for the use of computing in design, supported by the advancements in information technology and computer science.</p>
<p>In associative logic, the manipulation of shapes is performed directly, similar to how we draw a line on paper by moving our hand according to the desired line. However, when using associative logic in computer-based design, shape manipulation is achieved indirectly through algorithms. A line is not formed by the movement of our hand, but rather by calculating the distance between two points.</p>
<p>The architectural design process using computers is no longer limited to representational purposes; it harnesses the computer&rsquo;s capacity to think and execute instructions based on procedures created by the architect. This approach is known as computational thinking, which has evolved alongside the increasing complexity and speed of computer capabilities. Computers can quickly generate shapes based on algorithms devised by architects, complemented by the architect&rsquo;s logical thinking ability. The advantage of this approach is its ability to produce shapes that were previously challenging to achieve using conventional modeling techniques reliant on additive logic.</p>
<p>In general, computational thinking consists of four techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>decomposition</strong><br>
solving the problem by breaking the problem into several small problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>abstraction</strong><br>
recognizing the key components of the differences in the problem to develop a solution to several problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>pattern recognition</strong><br>
recognizing the similarity of components of a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>algorithm</strong><br>
a set of procedures to solve problems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Computational design is a design process that leverages computational thinking. It has continued to evolve in the field of architectural design alongside the advancements in information technology, giving rise to various new terms such as parametric design, algorithmic design, and generative design.</p>
