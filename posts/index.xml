By leveraging computational algorithms, generative design unlocks new possibilities and opens up uncharted territories in the realm of architectural exploration. Among the many techniques used in generative design, several prominent ones stand out, including cellular automata, genetic algorithms, shape grammar, and more.</p>
<p>Cellular automata, first introduced by mathematician John von Neumann and popularized by scientist Stephen Wolfram, provide a fascinating tool for generative design. Cellular automata involve a grid of cells, each governed by a set of rules and influenced by its neighboring cells. Through iterative computations, these rules determine the evolution and transformation of the cells, resulting in intricate and emergent patterns. In architecture, cellular automata can be applied to generate complex spatial configurations or dynamic façade designs that adapt to varying environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Genetic algorithms, inspired by the process of natural selection, offer another powerful tool for generative design. By simulating evolution through the principles of mutation, selection, and crossover, genetic algorithms generate diverse design solutions and iteratively refine them over time. Architects can define a set of parameters and constraints, allowing the algorithm to explore and optimize designs based on desired outcomes. This technique enables the discovery of novel and efficient solutions that often transcend human intuition.</p>
<p>Shape grammar is a rule-based technique that allows for the generation of architectural forms and compositions. By defining a grammar system composed of shapes, rules, and operations, architects can establish a generative process that generates complex designs based on a set of predefined grammar rules. Shape grammar provides a framework to generate designs that adhere to specific stylistic or functional requirements, while also allowing for variations and adaptation based on specific design intents.</p>
<p>Beyond these notable techniques, generative design encompasses a vast array of other methods and algorithms. These include neural networks, swarm intelligence, fractal geometry, and more. Each technique brings its unique strengths and applications to the generative design process, providing architects with a rich toolkit for exploring novel design possibilities.</p>
<p>Generative design, with its diverse range of techniques, revolutionizes the architectural design process. It transcends traditional design methods by enabling architects to embrace computational tools and algorithms to generate innovative and harmonious designs. The marriage of human creativity and computational power through techniques like cellular automata, genetic algorithms, and shape grammar fosters an exciting and fruitful synergy, pushing the boundaries of architectural exploration and opening up a world of unforeseen design possibilities.</p>

            <description>The use of computers in the field of architectural design initially only involved digitizing tasks that were traditionally done manually. Computer-based modeling or drawing still relied on additive logic, which involved adding overlapped information without associative relationships, heavily relying on the designer&amp;rsquo;s consistency. This additive logic persisted for a long time as it was considered stable for exploring and refining variations through traditional image media. However, this logic had limitations as it lacked connections between depicted elements and couldn&amp;rsquo;t incorporate physically relevant aspects that shape the generation of real-world forms.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The use of computers in the field of architectural design initially only involved digitizing tasks that were traditionally done manually. Computer-based modeling or drawing still relied on additive logic, which involved adding overlapped information without associative relationships, heavily relying on the designer&rsquo;s consistency. This additive logic persisted for a long time as it was considered stable for exploring and refining variations through traditional image media. However, this logic had limitations as it lacked connections between depicted elements and couldn&rsquo;t incorporate physically relevant aspects that shape the generation of real-world forms. These limitations prompted architects to develop their design mindset.</p>
<p>In 1963, a computer expert named Ivan Sutherland discovered a tool called the Sketchpad, which is considered the first CAD tool and served as a precursor to popular CAD computer applications in subsequent years. This marked the transition from additive logic to associative logic. Associative logic became the foundation for the use of computing in design, supported by the advancements in information technology and computer science.</p>
<p>In associative logic, the manipulation of shapes is performed directly, similar to how we draw a line on paper by moving our hand according to the desired line. However, when using associative logic in computer-based design, shape manipulation is achieved indirectly through algorithms. A line is not formed by the movement of our hand, but rather by calculating the distance between two points.</p>
<p>The architectural design process using computers is no longer limited to representational purposes; it harnesses the computer&rsquo;s capacity to think and execute instructions based on procedures created by the architect. This approach is known as computational thinking, which has evolved alongside the increasing complexity and speed of computer capabilities. Computers can quickly generate shapes based on algorithms devised by architects, complemented by the architect&rsquo;s logical thinking ability. The advantage of this approach is its ability to produce shapes that were previously challenging to achieve using conventional modeling techniques reliant on additive logic.</p>
<p>In general, computational thinking consists of four techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>decomposition</strong><br>
solving the problem by breaking the problem into several small problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>abstraction</strong><br>
recognizing the key components of the differences in the problem to develop a solution to several problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>pattern recognition</strong><br>
recognizing the similarity of components of a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>algorithm</strong><br>
a set of procedures to solve problems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Computational design is a design process that leverages computational thinking. It has continued to evolve in the field of architectural design alongside the advancements in information technology, giving rise to various new terms such as parametric design, algorithmic design, and generative design.</p>
